# robogym.py and rg.py work together. rg.py accepts commands from the keyboard and generates Robogym messages which are very
# very simple parsing of the commands. robogym.py subscribes to these messages and executes them. Neither needs to run `onboard`.
#
# The purpose is to help callibrate a robot by sending commands that can be performed by the robot and then measured because
# they are accurate.
#
# The commands are:
#
# reset = stops the robot motion
# move <linear-speed> <angular-speed> <rate> 
#   which will send a constant stream of cmd_vels of the stated linear and angular at the stated rate
# time <linear-speed> <angular-speed> <rate> <seconds>
#   which will send a stream of cmd_vels of the stated linear and angular at the stated rate for specified seconds
# count <linear-speed> <angular-speed> <rate> <count>
#   which will send a stream of exactly <count> cmd_vels of the stated linear and angular at the stated rate
# distance <linear-speed> <angular-speed> <rate> <distance>
#   which will send a stream of <count> cmd_vels of the stated linear and angular at the stated rate until the <distance> has been covered.
