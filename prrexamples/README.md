# Welcome Cosi119a to the PRRExamples supplementary repository!  

This repository is for Cosi119a - Autonomous Robotics.

There are numerous examples and samples here. You are welcome to use lines of code from any of them in your submitted homework. But don't submit while files, that would be considered stealing.

This directory also includes all of the code listed in the book Programming Robots with ROS book corrected so they runn correctly with later versions of ROS. It is meant as a supplement to the Programming Robots with ROS textbook.
